# NOTICE

Running any sort of remote UI (including this) is against the **Terms of Service**! Use at your own risk.

# Current flaws:
- Google Colab has a 12 hours per day limit for free users 
- Gradio not working correctly. To fix this use ngrok. Register if you don't have an account and change `other-args` to `--ngrok <token>`
